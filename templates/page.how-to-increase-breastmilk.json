The basic natural needs of a human nursling can best be met by the complete food coming from its own mother. Its benefits abound both for the baby and the mother like better health, illness prevention, better disposition and intimacy.

It is the child’s demand for milk that creates a stimulus that causes the body to produce more milk. It is a natural response of the mother’s body to act on the hunger of her child. Even for sleepy babies and those with mellow personalities who have inability to initiate feeding and require the prodding of their mothers to receive sustenance, it is the mother’s duty to ensure that her child is nursed at all times even if it means waking up her child. Allowing one’s baby to get as much milk from the first breast before switching to the other side gives him an opportunity to derive high-fat hindmilk that will give him enough calories to grow thru the milk-ejection reflex of his mom. It also contains “colostrums” which is the nutrient-rich thick first stage of breast milk.<\/p>","number_of_lines_shown":"none","read_more_label":"Read more","see_less_label":"See less","show_sound_control":false,"video_url":"","video_alt_text":"","enable_video_autoplay":false,"media_size":50,"media_layout":"first"}},"text_bTB63K":{"type":"text","settings":{"heading":"Rest and Relieve Stress","text_alignment":"left","page_text":"","width_content":100,"headingtext":"Rest and Relieve Stress","highlight_type":"underline","heading_base_size":100,"text":"<p>When a mother is sick or under stress, this can lower her supply of milk.
